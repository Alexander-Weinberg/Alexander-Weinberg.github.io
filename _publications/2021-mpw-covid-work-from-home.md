Using data from O∗NET, we construct two measures of an occupation’s potential exposure to social distancing measures: (i) the likelihood that the job can be conducted from home and (ii) the degree of physical proximity to others the job requires while at work. After validating these measures with comparable measures from ATUS as well as realized work-from-home rates during the pandemic, we employ them to study the characteristics of workers in these types of jobs. We find that workers in low-work-from-home or high-physical-proximity jobs are more economically vulnerable across various measures constructed from the CPS and PSID: They are less educated, of lower income, have fewer liquid assets relative to income, and are more likely renters. Finally, we show that occupations and types of workers predicted to be employed in low work-from-home jobs experienced greater declines in employment during the pandemic, consistent with the idea that they were more exposed to social distancing behavior.
